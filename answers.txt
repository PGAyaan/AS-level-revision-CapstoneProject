1. Abstraction in programming refers to the process of hiding unnecessary details and representing only essential features of an object or system.
2. Decomposition in computer science involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts or modules.
3. Stepwise refinement is a problem-solving technique where a complex problem is broken down into a series of simpler steps, each of which can be further refined until a solution is achieved.
4. Structured English is a method of writing algorithms using natural language combined with specific control structures such as loops and conditionals.
5. Flowcharts are graphical representations of algorithms or processes, consisting of symbols representing different operations and arrows indicating the flow of control.
6. Pseudocode is a high-level description of a computer program or algorithm, written in plain language with some programming language constructs.
7. In programming, a sequence refers to an ordered collection of elements or instructions that are executed in a specific order.
8. Identifiers are names given to program elements such as variables, functions, or constants, which are used to refer to these elements in the code.
9. Iteration is the repetition of a process or set of instructions in a computer program, typically using loops, to achieve a desired result.
10. Data types in programming define the type of data that a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it.
11. Program development involves several stages including problem analysis, algorithm design, coding, testing, and maintenance.
12. Abstraction is important in software engineering as it helps manage complexity, facilitates code reuse, and enhances maintainability.
13. Decomposition allows problems to be divided into manageable parts, making them easier to understand, develop, and maintain.
14. Stepwise refinement helps programmers focus on one aspect of a problem at a time, leading to clearer and more structured solutions.
15. Structured English uses standard language constructs such as IF-THEN-ELSE statements and WHILE loops to describe algorithms in a structured manner.
16. Flowcharts are particularly useful for visualizing the flow of control in an algorithm, identifying decision points, and understanding complex processes.
17. Pseudocode can aid in algorithm development by providing a high-level, language-independent representation of the algorithm's logic.
18. Sequences determine the order in which instructions are executed in a program, ensuring that operations are performed in a specified sequence.
19. Meaningful identifiers improve code readability and maintainability, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the code.
20. Iterative constructs such as loops allow programmers to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on a condition or a set number of iterations.
21. Primitive data types represent basic data elements such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans, while composite data types combine multiple elements into a single unit.
22. Program development typically begins with problem analysis, where the requirements are gathered and analyzed to identify the problem to be solved.
23. Abstraction layers in software architecture provide a hierarchical structure for organizing system components, with each layer representing a different level of abstraction.
24. Decomposition promotes modular programming by dividing a program into smaller, self-contained modules that can be developed and tested independently.
25. Stepwise refinement involves gradually breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable steps, refining each step until a complete solution is obtained.
26. Structured English employs natural language constructs along with control structures such as conditionals and loops to describe algorithms in a structured manner.
27. Flowchart symbols include shapes such as rectangles for process steps, diamonds for decision points, and arrows for the flow of control between steps.
28. Pseudocode constructs include sequential execution, conditionals (IF-THEN-ELSE), loops (WHILE, FOR), and variable assignments, among others.
29. Sequences determine the order of execution of instructions in a program, ensuring that operations are performed in a logical and predictable manner.
30. Identifiers in programming languages have certain characteristics such as being case-sensitive, starting with a letter or underscore, and not containing spaces or special characters.
